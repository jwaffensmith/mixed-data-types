/* === Question 1 Data Types === 

- I would create properties in an object with booleans as values to represent the light switch being on or off. 
(on and off as keys and true or false as values. 
Example:  
const lightSwitch = {
    lightOn: true,
    lightOff: false,
};

- I would use an object with the key being the username and the value being the email address as a string.
Example: 
const userEmail = {
    username: "email@address.com"
};

- I would use an array with strings.
Example:
const spaceship = ["hull", "laser blasters" , "tractor beam", "warp drive"];

- I would use an array with strings.
Example: 
const class = ["Jenna", "Student B", "Student C"];

- I would use an object with names as the keys and locations as strings for the values.
Example:
const studentLocations = {
    studentNameA: "Seattle",
    studentNameB: "Los Angeles",
    studentNameC: "Oakland",
};

- I would use an object that contains objects for each student. Names would be each object inside the object. 
First property would be location with a string as a value. 
The second property would have the key, "favoriteTvShows," with an array holding strings of each show. 
Example: 
const classInfo = {
    studentName: {
        Location:
        favoriteTvShows: ["favorite tv show", "another one here", "another one here"];
    }
};
